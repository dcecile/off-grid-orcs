# First Orc (font)
_A 6x6 pixel font for [Off-Grid Orcs](https://github.com/dcecile/off-grid-orcs)_

## Files

Thanks for downloading the First Orc font! Included in the ZIP file are
four different font files:

 - `FirstOrcShort-Regular.ttf`: The standard 6x6 font
 - `FirstOrcTall-Regular.ttf`: A double-height 6x12 variant of the 6x6 font
 - `FirstOrcShort-Regular.png`: (input file for `bitfontmake`)
 - `FirstOrcTall-Regular.png`: (input file for `bitfontmake`)

After installing the TTF files, you should be able to select the font as
"First Orc Short" or "First Orc Tall".

## Metrics

To get pixel-perfect text, set your font size to a multiple of 6 pixels
(for the short font) or a multiple of 12 pixels (for the tall font). The
uppercase glyphs will be exactly the same height as your font size.

By default, the line height will be your font size times 8/6 (for the
short font) or 14/12 (for the tall font), and the advance width of each
glyph will be your font size times 7/6.

## Bugs

I'm always interested in making improvements to the font, so if you encounter
any bugs, let me know by emailing me at dancecile@gmail.com or by creating an
issue at https://github.com/dcecile/first-orc-font/issues.

## New glyphs

If there's a glyph (or character set) you think would be a good fit for the
First Orc font, send me an email at dancecile@gmail.com or create an issue at
